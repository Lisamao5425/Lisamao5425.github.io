<h2 style="text-align:center">Female Workforce in China</h2>
<p>Grew up in China, I have acknowledged that gender equality has always been an issue in my home country. To reveal the unfair social standing female workforce has been suffering through, I created this interactive graph to showcase the huge gender gap existed in the employment of leadership roles in China.</p>

<p>By simply hovering over each bar section, the floating textbox will showcase the exact employment rate of each major leadership role in China. Besides, the college enrollment rate is also included in this chart.</p>

<p>This interactive graph is generated based on a <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/juan-cb/43f10523858abf6053ae">pre-existing D3 model</a> and a site of <a href="http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/women-workforce-china">related secondary data</a>. </p>
